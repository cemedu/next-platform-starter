    "answer": "A closure in JavaScript is a function that has access to its own scope, the scope of the outer function, and the global scope. It allows a function to retain access to variables from its containing scope even after that function has finished executing. For example, a function defined inside another function can access the outer function's variables.\n\nA closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). When you create a closure, you gain access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. Closures are automatically created every time a function is defined in JavaScript.\n\nfunction foo() {\n    let b = 1;\n    function inner() {\n        return b;\n    }\n    return inner;\n}\nlet get_func_inner = foo();\n\nconsole.log(get_func_inner());\nconsole.log(get_func_inner());\nconsole.log(get_func_inner());\n\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n\n<body>\n    <h2>JavaScript Closures</h2>\n    <button type=\"button\" onclick=\"initaccount()\">\n          Click Me!\n        </button>\n    <p id=\"demo\"></p>\n    <script>\n    function initaccount() {\n        var balance = 1000;\n\n        function currentbalance() {\n            balance = balance - 100;\n            alert(balance);\n        }\n        currentbalance();\n    }\n    </script>\n</body>\n\n</html>\n",

    "answer": "Handling vendor prefixes in SASS can be managed by using mixins or tools like `autoprefixer`. Define mixins for common properties with prefixes, such as `@mixin flex() { display: -webkit-box; display: -moz-box; display: -ms-flexbox; display: -webkit-flex; display: flex; }`. Alternatively, use `autoprefixer` in your build process to automatically add necessary prefixes, ensuring cross-browser compatibility with less manual effort.",

    "answer": "In Vue.js, `v-if` and `v-show` are both used for conditional rendering, but they work differently. `v-if` adds or removes elements from the DOM based on the condition, making it suitable for cases where elements are toggled rarely. In contrast, `v-show` toggles the `display` CSS property of the element, keeping it in the DOM but hiding it from view. `v-show` is more performant for frequently toggled elements since it avoids the cost of re-rendering, while `v-if` is more efficient for infrequent toggling.",

You can create a custom directive by using `Vue.directive('directiveName', { ... })` for global registration or by defining it in the `directives` option of a component for local use. Directives allow you to encapsulate custom behavior that can be applied to DOM elements. For example, you might create a directive to handle custom tooltips or advanced interactions, using hooks like `bind`, `update`, and `unbind` to define its behavior.",

    "answer": "A Vue.js watcher is a mechanism for observing and reacting to changes in reactive data properties. By defining a watcher in the `watch` option of a Vue component, you can execute custom logic when a specific data property changes. For example, `watch: { count(newValue) { console.log('Count changed to:', newValue); } }` watches the `count` property and logs its new value whenever it changes. Watchers are useful for performing side effects, such as fetching data or updating other parts of the component, in response to changes in state.",

    "answer": "In Vue.js, `v-model` can be used with custom components to enable two-way data binding. To implement this, your custom component should emit an `input` event with the updated value when the data changes. For example, in your component, you would use `this.$emit('input', newValue)` to notify the parent component of changes. Additionally, you need to define the `model` option in your component to specify the prop used for binding. For instance, `model: { prop: 'value', event: 'input' }` configures the component to use the `value` prop and `input` event for `v-model` binding. This setup ensures that changes to the custom component’s data are reflected in the parent component and vice versa.",

    "answer": "Vue.js lifecycle hooks are methods that allow you to execute code at specific stages of a component’s lifecycle. These hooks include `created`, `mounted`, `updated`, and `destroyed`. For example, `created` is called after the component instance has been created but before it is mounted, while `mounted` is called after the component is mounted to the DOM. These hooks provide opportunities to perform actions such as fetching data, initializing third-party libraries, or cleaning up resources. Using lifecycle hooks helps manage the component’s behavior and state throughout its existence.",

    "answer": "The `v-model` directive in Vue.js provides two-way data binding for form elements and custom components. It binds a form input's value to a data property and automatically updates the data property when the input value changes. For example, `<input v-model='text'>` binds the `text` data property to the input’s value. When the input changes, `text` is updated accordingly, and vice versa. `v-model` can also be used with custom components by configuring the component to emit an `input` event and using the `model` option to specify the prop for binding.",

Filters are applied using the `|` character in template expressions. For example, `{{ message | uppercase }}` applies the `uppercase` filter to `message`. Filters can be defined globally or locally in Vue components. To define a global filter, use `Vue.filter('filterName', function(value) { /* transform value */ })`. Local filters are defined within the `filters` option of a component and provide a way to handle common formatting tasks directly in your templates.",

Weak algorithms, such as outdated or insecure hash functions, can make it easier for attackers to forge tokens or bypass verification processes. For example, using a weak algorithm like HS256 with a simple key could be vulnerable to brute-force attacks. To ensure robust security, use strong and modern signing algorithms like RS256 or ES256, and maintain a secure, complex signing key to protect against unauthorized token manipulation.",

MVCC allows transactions to work with snapshots of the database, minimizing locking conflicts. Each transaction operates with a consistent view of the data as of the start of the transaction. For example, when a transaction updates a row, PostgreSQL creates a new version of the row, ensuring other transactions see the previous version until they complete.",

    "answer": "In a RESTful API, user authentication is typically handled using methods such as API keys, OAuth tokens, or JWTs. When a user authenticates, they receive a token that must be included in the Authorization header of subsequent API requests. This token is validated by the server to ensure the request is from an authenticated user. Additionally, secure communication should be enforced using HTTPS, and proper error handling and validation should be implemented to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.",

Typically, this involves something the user knows (e.g., password) and something the user possesses (e.g., a code sent to their phone or generated by an authentication app). By adding this extra layer of verification, 2FA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if the primary credential is compromised.
