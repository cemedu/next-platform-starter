By using `v-on` followed by the event name, such as `v-on:click`, you can bind event listeners to methods or inline expressions. Vue provides a shorthand `@` for `v-on`, making it easier to write event handlers.

Computed properties are defined in the `computed` option of a Vue component and are used for performing calculations or transformations of data. Unlike methods, computed properties are cached based on their dependencies, meaning they are only recalculated when the dependent data changes. This makes computed properties efficient for scenarios where derived data needs to be computed from existing state."

By defining a watcher in the `watch` option of a Vue component, you can specify a function that will be called whenever the watched property changes. This is useful for performing side effects, such as making API calls or triggering additional updates, in response to changes in the component's state.

In contrast, `v-show` toggles the `display` CSS property of the element, keeping it in the DOM but hiding it from view. `v-show` is more performant for frequently toggled elements since it avoids the cost of re-rendering, while `v-if` is more efficient for infrequent toggling."

By adding a `ref` attribute to an element or component, you create a reference that can be accessed via `this.$refs` in the Vue instance. This is useful for interacting with the DOM or child components imperatively, such as focusing an input element or calling methods on a child component.

Filters are applied within double curly braces `{{ }}` or with the `v-bind` directive. They allow you to format or modify the output of data before it is rendered. For example, a date filter can format a date string to a more readable format. Filters can be registered globally or locally within components and are useful for keeping templates clean and separating formatting logic from the main template."

An event bus is typically created by instantiating a new Vue instance and using it to manage event emission and listening. For example, `const eventBus = new Vue()` creates an event bus, and components can use `eventBus.$emit('eventName', data)` to emit events and `eventBus.$on('eventName', callback)` to listen for them.

Running `npm run build` or `yarn build` creates a production-ready version of the application with minified and optimized code. This build process includes code splitting, tree shaking, and other optimizations to improve performance. You can further customize the build configuration through `vue.config.js` to set up environment variables, configure webpack options, and ensure that the application is well-optimized for deployment in production environments."

A mixin is a JavaScript object that contains component options such as data, methods, and lifecycle hooks. By including a mixin in a component, you can reuse the mixin’s functionality without duplicating code. This helps keep components modular and maintainable. However, overusing mixins can lead to complexity and naming conflicts, so they should be used judiciously and ideally complemented by other techniques like Composition API for more modular and scalable code."

These hooks include `beforeCreate`, `created`, `beforeMount`, `mounted`, `beforeUpdate`, `updated`, `beforeDestroy`, and `destroyed`. Each hook corresponds to a particular phase of the component's lifecycle, from its creation to its destruction. By using these hooks, developers can perform actions such as data fetching, setup, and cleanup, and manage side effects or interactions with the DOM at precise moments."

To implement this, your custom component should emit an `input` event with the updated value when the data changes. For example, in your component, you would use `this.$emit('input', newValue)` to notify the parent component of changes. Additionally, you need to define the `model` option in your component to specify the prop used for binding. For instance, `model: { prop: 'value', event: 'input' }` configures the component to use the `value` prop and `input` event for `v-model` binding.

Filters can be applied in template expressions and provide a way to format data like dates or numbers. For example, `{{ price | currency('USD') }}` applies a `currency` filter to the `price` data property. Filters are defined globally or locally in a Vue component and can be used to perform common formatting tasks, making it easier to handle data presentation consistently across the application."

                "answer": "Vue.js handles event delegation by allowing you to listen to events on parent elements and handle them within child components. This can be achieved using the `v-on` directive to listen for events and pass event data to methods. For instance, `<button @click='handleClick'>Click me</button>` listens for click events on a button and triggers the `handleClick` method. Additionally, Vue supports event modifiers such as `.stop` and `.prevent` to control event propagation and default behavior, giving you fine-grained control over event handling and delegation."

                "answer": "The `provide` and `inject` API in Vue.js allows for sharing data between ancestor and descendant components without prop drilling. The `provide` option is used in an ancestor component to specify the data or methods to be shared, while the `inject` option is used in descendant components to access the provided data. For example, `provide() { return { theme: 'dark' } }` in an ancestor component provides the `theme` data, and `inject: ['theme']` in a descendant component allows access to this data. This pattern helps manage global state or shared data in a hierarchical component structure."

For example, `<template v-slot:default='slotProps'>{{ slotProps.text }}</template>` in the child component exposes `slotProps` to the parent, which can then use this data to render content.

For instance, you can define a mixin with common methods and data properties and then include it in different components. For example, `const myMixin = { methods: { commonMethod() { /*...*/ } } };` can be mixed into components using `mixins: [myMixin]`.

Vuex provides a centralized store for managing state and includes concepts such as state, getters, mutations, and actions. The state holds the application data, getters are used to derive computed state, mutations handle synchronous state changes, and actions manage asynchronous operations. To use Vuex, create a store using `new Vuex.Store({ state, getters, mutations, actions })` and include it in your Vue instance. This setup ensures consistent and predictable state management across your application."

This involves emitting an `input` event with the updated value and defining the `model` option. For instance, in your component, use `this.$emit('input', newValue)` to notify the parent of changes. Additionally, configure the component with the `model` option: `model: { prop: 'value', event: 'input' }`. This setup allows `v-model` to bind to the `value` prop and use the `input` event for updating the parent component’s state, enabling seamless two-way data binding."

To define an async component, use a function that returns a Promise resolving to the component definition. For example, `const AsyncComponent = () => import('./MyComponent.vue')`. You can then use this async component in your templates like a regular component. Vue also provides a built-in `defineAsyncComponent` function for defining async components.

For example, `<li v-for='item in items' :key='item.id'>{{ item.name }}</li>` uses `item.id` as the unique key for each list item.

For instance, `Vue.config.errorHandler = (err, vm, info) => { console.error(err); }` logs errors globally. For component-specific error boundaries, you can use the `errorCaptured` lifecycle hook to catch errors in child components.

On the other hand, `props` are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props are immutable within the child component and are used to provide external data.

Custom directives provide hooks such as `bind`, `inserted`, `update`, and `unbind` to handle various stages of directive lifecycle. For example, a custom directive for focusing an element might look like: `Vue.directive('focus', { inserted(el) { el.focus(); } });`.

This function takes a `createElement` function as an argument and allows you to describe the structure of your component using JavaScript. For example, `render(h) { return h('div', [h('span', 'Hello')]) }` creates a `div` with a `span` element inside it. The `render` function provides greater control over component rendering and is useful for advanced scenarios where dynamic component generation or custom rendering logic is required."
